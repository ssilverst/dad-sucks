## A retro game implemented in [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) :) ##
Dad Sucks! is a retro game I created for the game jam "My First Game Jam".

Your dad is the ruler of Hell and he's kinda lame if you ask me. He lets the lost souls loose and makes it your responsibility to clean up the mess... or face eternal damnation...

Controls are:
1. **→**, **←**, **↑**, & **↓** to move
2. **R** to pick up objects
3. **T** to drop souls in the bag (of souls)
4. **Q** to quit the game

## You can do a lot of things in this game like ## 
1. Moving
2. Dancing (to a **cool** soundtrack)
3. Dodging bullets
4. Beating high scores
5. **hard mode**

## Installation ## 
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
2. Install [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) using their instructions
3. Clone or copy this repository
4. `python3 main.py` at the command line (if on windows use `py main.py`).
